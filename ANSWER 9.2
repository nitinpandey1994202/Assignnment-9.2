QUESTION:-
Explain the working of below pig script commands with an example :
 1. LOAD
 2. STORE
 3. DUMP
 4. FOREACH
 5. FILTER
 6. GROUP BY
 7. ORDER BY
 8. DESCRIBE


1)LOAD
Load data from the file system (local/HDFS) into a relation.
a = load '/hadoopdata/pig/abc.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (a1:int, a2:int, a3:int);

2)STORE
store or save a relation to the file system (local/HDFS).
STORE l INTO '/pigoutput';

3)DUMP
display/print  the contents of a relation on the output screen.
Dump a ;

4)FOREACH
To generate data transformation based on columns of data.
l = FOREACH c GENERATE a1, a2, a2*a3;

5)FILTER
As a name suggest to filter something from database as our buisness requirement or we can say that Remove unwanted rows from a relation.
f = FILTER c by $1 > 3;

6)GROUP BY 
Group the data in a single relation.
g = GROUP c by $1;
as above, it will group the one who have position 1 in a row bag.
g = GROUP c by ($0,$3); 

h = GROUP c ALL;

7)ORDER BY 
Arrange a relation in a sorted order based on one or more fields (ascending or descending).
f = order c by a1 desc ;
 
8)DESCRIBE
